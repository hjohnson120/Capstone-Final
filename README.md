# Do Something!

![](https://recordit.co/idUsLhQiZp.gif)

Volunteering at public schools is a great way to give back to the community and school system. However, the process of signing up to volunteer can be time consuming. "Do Something!" allows the user to create an account, set search preferences and sign up for volunteer spots with a click of a button. I also allows schools to register and post volunteer opportunities at their school. This project uses REACT with hooks, Javascript, APIs, Authentication, SQL, Postgres, EF Core, .NET Core, Docker and C#.
